# ðŸš€ Fraud Detection with SVM and Random Forest ðŸ“ˆ

## Overview

This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest classifiers. The dataset used for this project contains various transaction records, and the goal is to identify anomalies that could indicate fraudulent activities.

## Features

- **SVM and Random Forest Models**: Utilize SVM and Random Forest classifiers to detect fraudulent transactions.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess transaction data for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features to enhance model performance.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify anomalies in transactions.
- **Behavioral Modeling**: Analyze transaction patterns to identify unusual behavior.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assess model performance using various metrics.

## Requirements

- **Python**: 3.7 or higher
- **Dataset**: https://datalink.youdata.ai/235cy5ae

## Usage

1. **Preprocess the Data**: Prepare the dataset by cleaning and transforming it.
2. **Detect Anomalies**: Identify suspicious transactions based on predefined rules.
3. **Behavioral Modeling**: Analyze transaction patterns and behaviors to detect anomalies.
4. **Train and Evaluate Models**: Train SVM and Random Forest models and evaluate their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Example Usage

This project provides a structured approach to detecting fraud in transaction data. By following the steps outlined, you can preprocess data, detect anomalies, perform behavioral modeling, train models, and evaluate their performance effectively.
